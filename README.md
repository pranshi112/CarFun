    - Before placing the car, scan your environment deliberately with the phone's camera to see ambient reflections on the car.
    - Now, position the blue circle at some location and place the car's model there using the  _Place Car_ button.
    - You can hide the blue circle and the _Place Car_ button using the **UI** button on the top-right.
4. After placing the car, you can
    - Change its color using the _Color Palette_ button on the top-left. By pressing the button again, the colour UI can be hidden.
